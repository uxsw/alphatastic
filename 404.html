    <p class="at-message">
      We are sorry to say that Alphatastic is no longer in operation. Since 2010 we have created our unique artworks for thousands of children, and we would like to thank each and every one of you for supporting our little business over these years. Alphatastic allowed us to work around bringing up our two little children, but as they are now that bit older, the time has now come to move on to a new part of our lives. We haven't ruled out restarting the business one day, but for at least the foreseeable few years, it will be dormant with no facility to produce our artworks.  After 1st January 2019, our email addresses will become dormant with no ability to be contacted.
    <br/><br />Wishing you all well<br />
      Matt &amp; Terri
      <br /><br />
